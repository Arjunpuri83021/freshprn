# Unique Content Strategy - Video Pages

## Problem Solved
Previous implementation had similar content structure across all video pages. Google needs **truly unique content** on each page for proper indexing.

## Dynamic Content Generation Strategy

### 1. **Conditional Content Based on Video Attributes**

Every video page now generates **completely different content** based on:

#### A. Number of Tags
- **1 tag**: "This video belongs to the [tag] category..."
- **2 tags**: "Combining [tag1] and [tag2] themes..."
- **3+ tags**: "This video spans [X] categories: [list]..."

#### B. Number of Performers
- **1 performer**: "[Name] delivers an outstanding performance..."
- **2 performers**: "Dynamic duo of [Name1] and [Name2]..."
- **3+ performers**: "All-star cast featuring [names]..."

#### C. View Count Tiers
- **10,000+ views**: "Trending Video" section
- **5,000-10,000 views**: "Popular Choice" section
- **1,000-5,000 views**: "Rising Star" section
- **<1,000 views**: "Fresh Content" section

#### D. Video Duration
- **30+ minutes**: "Extended experience with multiple scenes..."
- **15-30 minutes**: "Perfectly balanced duration..."
- **<15 minutes**: "Quick watch, straight to action..."

### 2. **Dynamic Headings**

Headings change based on video data:
- Tags: "Category" vs "Categories" vs "Multiple Categories"
- Performers: "Featured Star" vs "2 Performers" vs "All-Star Cast"
- Popularity: "Trending" vs "Popular" vs "Rising Star" vs "Fresh"

### 3. **Dynamic FAQ Questions**

Questions adapt to video attributes:
- Long videos: "Why is this video longer than average?"
- Short videos: "Is this a quick watch?"
- Multiple performers: "Who are all the performers?"
- Single performer: "What else has [Name] done?"
- Many tags: "Why so many categories?"
- Popular videos: "Why is this video so popular?"

### 4. **Unique Combinations Create Millions of Variations**

**Example Calculation:**
- 5 duration ranges × 4 view tiers × 3 performer counts × 3 tag counts = **180 base variations**
- Each variation has different:
  - Performer names (thousands)
  - Tag names (hundreds)
  - View counts (unique numbers)
  - Durations (unique numbers)
  
**Result**: Virtually **infinite unique content combinations**

## Content Examples

### Example 1: Popular Video with Multiple Performers
**Video**: 25 minutes, 8,500 views, 3 performers, 7 tags

**Generated Content**:
- Heading: "Popular Choice"
- Description: "With 8,500 views and counting, this 25 minute video is quickly becoming a fan favorite..."
- Performers: "An all-star cast featuring [Name1], [Name2], [Name3]..."
- Categories: "This video spans 7 categories: [tag1], [tag2], [tag3]..."
- FAQ: "Who are all the performers?" + "Why so many categories?"

### Example 2: Fresh Short Video with Solo Performer
**Video**: 12 minutes, 450 views, 1 performer, 2 tags

**Generated Content**:
- Heading: "Fresh Content"
- Description: "Be among the first to discover this 12 minute exclusive video..."
- Performers: "[Name] delivers an outstanding performance in this 12 minute video..."
- Categories: "Combining [tag1] and [tag2] themes, this video offers a unique viewing experience..."
- FAQ: "Is this a quick watch?" + "What else has [Name] done?"

### Example 3: Trending Long Video
**Video**: 45 minutes, 15,000 views, 2 performers, 4 tags

**Generated Content**:
- Heading: "Trending Video"
- Description: "This is one of our most-watched videos with an impressive 15,000 views!..."
- Performers: "This video features the dynamic duo of [Name1] and [Name2]..."
- Categories: "This video spans 4 categories: [tag1], [tag2], [tag3], [tag4]..."
- FAQ: "Why is this video longer than average?" + "Why is this video so popular?"
